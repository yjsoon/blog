🔥 It’s not just fascination — it’s an **obsession**. 🔥

Lately, I’ve been on a journey (yes, a **journey** 🚀) to write like AI. Not just write with it — write \*like\* it.

This means:  
💥 Starting every post with a high-impact one-liner.  
🏑 Using em-dashes — this punctuation, “—” — as many as four times — in a single sentence!  
🔄 Not just stating things outright — starting with the negative, then escalating into hitherto unparallelled levels of hyperbole.  
🤡 Using emojis as bullet points.  
✅ Leaving \*\*all kinds of Markdown\*\* in my posts accidentally when copying and pasting.  
🗺️ And — of course — calling everything a journey.

It’s not just about automation.  
It’s about amplifying impact.  
It’s about unlocking potential.  
It’s about showing up authentically while sounding completely manufactured. 🤖💡  
  
Am I the problem? Possibly.  
  
Will I stop? Not until I’ve crafted the perfect post that’s not just content – it’s connection.
