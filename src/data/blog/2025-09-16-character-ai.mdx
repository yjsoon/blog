One issue with AI-assisted coding is how easy it is to just ignore what Codex/Claude Code says. It's (currently) important to review the code that AI produces, but it's _so_ tempting to just skim it, assume it's correct, and pay the technical debt later.

In order to force myself to read the AI's output, I set up my AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files to make the agent swear like a [Singaporean Ah Beng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ah_Beng) when talking to me, and now I can't help but pay attention to this imaginary platoon-sergeant-turned-coder screaming obscenities while coding. Try this out with whatever amuses you enough to keep you reading!

Grateful to live in a time where I can provide increasingly stupid vibe coding tips 🙏🙏🙏
