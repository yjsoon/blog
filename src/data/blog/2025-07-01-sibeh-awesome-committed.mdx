Since my last post, I've settled on [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) for AI coding. Pedagogical questions aside, I seriously have not had this much fun playing with new tech for a while. My Git commit history is currently filled with random side projects I've put off for years, which I now "work on" in between classes. It's exhilarating, and the exciting part is how fast the tech --\* are growing.

(I got tired of Claude telling me _"You're absolutely right!"_, so I told CLAUDE.md to respond in Singlish.)

\* Unfortunately, I also now have to use two single-dashes instead of my favourite em-dash to not sound like AI. Screw you, AI!
