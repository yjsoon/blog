We started [Tinkertanker](http://tinkertanker.com/) in 2011, and haven't written much about the company and what we do. As a result, we now regularly get emails from people who think we run an actual tanker.

_Maritime recruiters, please stop sending us crew member CVs! We don't run a ship! We'll let you know when we buy one okay, but COEs are expensive_

So, here we go:

A paper version of TKrobot, our mascot. We squished him once accidentally, and he's been mad at us since.

**Who we are. **Tinkertanker is a technology and education company. We're coders who enjoy teaching, teachers who enjoy coding, and coders who enjoy teaching, and people who repeat themselves. (Did we mention we're teachers who"¦)

**Our products. **We run [Tinkercademy](http://tinkercademy.com/), where we teach coding and electronics to students of all ages; [GuestDay](http://guestday.com/), an iPad-based guest registration service; [Get Hacking](http://gethacking.com/), an online store for technology toys and tools; and various smaller tech projects, like [125andup](http://125andup.sg/), which we recently retired, and our [IC Photo](http://icphoto.tinkertanker.com/) app, which, uhh, we should probably get around to updating before Apple kicks us off the App Store.

**What we do. **Our core strengths are in building software, teaching technology, and creating with electronics; essentially, we spend our time making cool stuff with technology, or teaching folks how to do the same. Not everyone in our team codes and teaches, but we all enjoy tinkering with open-source frameworks, electronics, 3D printing, laser cutting, design tools, and more.

**The office**. Our office at Tai Seng is a workshop, lab, and warehouse, with a well-stocked pantry that usually doesn't contain solder or wood chips. We have _three_ Michelin-starred eateries [within walking distance](https://www.facebook.com/18TaiSeng/), so that lets us get pretty fat.

**Our technology stack.** While most of our current production code is in Ruby and Objective-C, we have projects implemented in other languages„—„”„—Python, PHP, Clojure, Squeak. We teach in Python, Swift, Java, HTML, CSS, flavour-of-the-year JavaScript framework, Unity C#, Arduino C, Scratch, and more. Our upcoming projects are an Android app (Android Studio, Java), an iOS app (Xcode, Swift), and a micro-controller compiler (a healthy mix of C++, JavaScript, and staring at one another suspiciously).

So, there we go, an introduction to this little company we call our own. We'll keep this post updated as we evolve, and we hope to tell you more about what we do in future posts, which may or may not take another 6 years. Stay tuned!
