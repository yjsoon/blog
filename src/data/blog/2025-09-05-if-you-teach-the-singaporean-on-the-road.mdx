A former student posted this heartfelt piece about why they're leaving Singapore, titled "[if you meet the singaporean on the road](https://substack.com/inbox/post/172555058)". It's a great read, and resonated strongly with their audience on Twitter.

I met up with them for lunch yesterday, amidst the throngs of students leaving school early from their Teachers' Day celebrations, just to catch up and wish them well on their next step. Afterwards, I just sat for a bit and marvelled at how lucky we are as teachers â€” to get these precious glimpses of young lives growing and becoming themselves.

Happy Teachers' Day to all who teach and who've taught: my family, friends, colleagues, and of course teachers.

(This student will be in the SF Bay Area, and if anyone in my network is happy to lend them any kind of support, let me know; I'm sure they'd appreciate the connection.)
