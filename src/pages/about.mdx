Hello! I'm **YJ Soon**, from and in Singapore. Depending on the time of day, I'm a teacher, programmer, designer, person who draws chickens (phrased this way because "chicken drawer" would be a notably different activity), and/or business owner.

## Work

- [Tinkertanker](https://tinkertanker.com): The company I co-founded with my friends Akmal and Steven.
  - [Tinkercademy](https://tinkercademy.com): Education branding of Tinkertanker. We teach coding and making to learners of all ages.
  - [Swift Accelerator](https://swiftinsg.org): A year-long talent development programme I run for aspiring young app developers, supported by IMDA and Apple.
  - [Tinkerer's Guide to the micro:bit Galaxy](https://tgttmg.tk.sg): A book we wrote during the pandemic.
  - [IC Photo](https://icphoto.tinkertanker.com) was our first iOS app. Hundreds of thousands of downloads! Years and years of neglect!
- [Get Hacking](https://gethacking.com): Online store run by [Tinker Class](https://tinkerclass.tech), a joint venture between Tinkertanker and Classroom HK.
- [Tinkermind](https://tinkermind.sg): A maker education company that Tinkertanker holds a minority stake in.

## Projects

- Programming projects
  - [This blog](https://github.com/yjsoon/blog), running on [Astro](https://astro.build) on the [Astro Paper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
  - [Bamboobot Cert Generator](https://bamboobot.tk.sg): Interactive NextJS app to generate certificates of achievement with text embedded in PDF. [Source](https://github.com/tinkertanker/bamboobot-cert-generator).
  - [YNAB Rewards](https://rewards.soon.sg): A rewards tracker for people who use [YNAB](https://ynab.com) and obsessively categorise their transactions to maximise their credit cards rewards. [Source](https://github.com/yjsoon/ynab-rewards.tracker).
  - [JustNow for Mac (suorce only)](https://github.com/yjsoon/justnow): I quite liked Rewind.app, but it went away. This is a simplified version I use for when I close tabs accidentally and lose what I was typing, which I am wont to do because I am easily distracted.
  - [DF Style Linked List WordPress plugin](https://github.com/yjsoon/df-style-linked-list_wordpress-plugin): An old WordPress plugin for my old blog, to make "link posts" a la [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net). Haven't touched for over a decade, sorry!
- Super, super old 3D animations my friends and I made in high school in the late 90s, using 3D Studio R4 or something:
  - [Teapots: Once Upon A Time in China](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Mw1mhCZvwLQ)
  - [The Duckness of Space](https://youtube.com/watch?v=vuekAy5mGec)
  - [3D Qbasic Gorillas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm7kP7eSrD8)
