I drove the dad's car to work yesterday so I could pack and bring home most of my stuff from camp. Having lost my duffel bag to one of the OCs who borrowed it for an overseas exercise last year and never returned it, I had to move my gear to the car separately, with the help of some colleagues. Upon returning home, however, I had way too much crap to carry upstairs by myself, so I left my SBO, helmet and boots in the trunk. It struck me that this was just like the military defence bit in the recent Total Defence TV ads, where the guy was mobilised and had his gear all ready in his car trunk (with, oddly enough, nothing else in there). (Quote from a regular watching that ad: &#8220;Har? Where got people so operationally ready one? I don't even know where my SBO is!&#8221; -- at which point we stared at him and questioned his effectiveness as a regular combat platoon commander.) I think I'll leave them there to amuse myself whenever I open the trunk. Ahh, operational readiness, here I come.
