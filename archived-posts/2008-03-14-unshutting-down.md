I'm back for a bit, because I think I actually have things to write about. For example... A [friend](http://progprog.com) gave a talk to my computing students about working in the software industry (thanks Tim), and one of the points he mentioned was keeping a professional blog for all of one's work-related writings. With what I've been (slowly, slowly, very slowly) figuring out in this most recent web development project, I figure it's about time I started collating information somewhere, even if it's just to be able to track my own "professional development" (hooray for work-speak). I'll be cross-posting those entries to this blog, so I'll just keep the URL to myself. Furthermore, I do want to draw again, and I do want to launch _Stupid Chicken: The Comic_ at some point (this decade). My printer/scanner/tea-maker doesn't seem to work with Mac OS X Leopard, though, so I can't quite get started. Damned HP printer... the model number is PSC something, which might explain my unnatural antagonism towards it. Also, I've lost track of what I was trying to explain here, but in essence, I'm going to try and bring back the webcomic here (and get around to setting up the separate site sometime). I also met up with a [former colleague](http://sirfong.blogspot.com/) who's finally quit to pursue his dreams full-time. Plenty of food for thought from that conversation, and some things I do feel the need to write about. Speaking of colleagues, I came across [another colleague's blog](http://lovingeveryday.blogspot.com/), and it's SO. OVERWHELMINGLY. POSITIVE. I'm not sure I can even bring myself to be cynical about what he writes -- from what I know of him, he really does seem to be someone who thoroughly believes in his job, his faith and his life. So, yeah, thank goodness for everyone he's in teaching, but then, what the hell am I doing in this job? And, hell, I'm actually still really fucking depressed from that whole mess from the end of 2006. I might even write about that, in a departure from my usual spew of vagueness. Maybe.
