My favourite sitcom _Scrubs_ finally got nominated for the Emmys -- Best Comedy and Best Comedy Lead Actor for [Zach Braff](http://gardenstate.typepad.com/zach_braffs_garden_state_/). Granted, the former is really only because heavyweights _Friends_, _Sex and the City_ and _Frasier_ have finally gone away, but it's nice to see this smartly-written comedy finally get some attention it deserves. The latter nomination is probably an extension of Braff's success in _Garden State_, but it's a start. Pity John C. McGinley (the absurdly sarcastic Dr. Cox) didn't get nominated in the supporting comedy actor category, instead losing out to hacks like _Will and Grace_'s Sean Hayes. Seriously, what the hell is that?! Other random thing: [Baybeats](http://www.baybeats.net/) tomorrow will actually feature Concave Scream, my favourite local band. Holy shit! I thought they'd disappeared years ago. I remember buying _Erratic_ in JC, and I couldn't get enough of their post-punk-tense-rock (or however you'd describe it -- somewhat New Model Army, I say). After I got back from the US, Eek and I spent hours trying to locate their MP3s because I'd lost my original CD. Finally, I managed to order it again through mp3.com before it shut down, and also found their next album, _Three_, at Audiophile. Excellent stuff still. Somewhat drained from the week, really. One has to take the random pleasing things as they show up...
