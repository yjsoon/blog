Before:

switch ($variable) {
    case $option1:
        //Code here
        break;
    case $option2:
        //Code here
        break;
    default:
        //Code here
        break;
}

After:

what\_about (£variable) {
    perhaps £possibility:
        //Code here
        splendid;
    perhaps £other\_possibility:
        //Code here
        splendid;
    on\_the\_off\_chance:
        //Code here
        splendid;
}
