I've moved on-campus. The room's big and spartan and I feel like we could fit a car between the two beds, if necessary. Today was the first day of classes, mostly introductory fare and largely bearable despite the overly long two-hour lectures. School (er, &#8220;work&#8221;, loosely defined) doesn't feel like anything big and new and terrifying yet -- maybe it'll all sink in when a few of my best friends start leaving in the coming weeks. Aiy, life moves on way too quickly.
