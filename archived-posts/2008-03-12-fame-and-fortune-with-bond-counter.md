About half a year ago, to celebrate the halfway point of my scholarship bond, I wrote a simple Facebook application called [Bond Counter](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=bbd24cbaa4b6c821273d3a6132e92b8b).Â The program simply plonks a countdown on one's profile page that describes how long more one has left in indentured servitude, probably to some Singaporean government body (and, optionally, how much money is left in that bond). An excerpt from an article ([PDF](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/fame.pdf "PDF")) talking about scholarship bonds from today's edition of "My Paper", a local daily publication:

> There's even an application on Facebook which tracks the number of days one has left to serve out.

Yes! Fame and fortune! Someone buy out my app, with all its 500 users!
