No more: the &#8220;links for&#8221; posts just weren't entertaining enough, even by my low standards. Also, it hurts my addled brain to have to think of whether I _really_ want this link I'm bookmarking to appear on my blog... Still, though, [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us): best bookmarking service ever. The &#8220;School Experience&#8221; goes well, in general, but given that it's my last week here, I've given up on really preparing lesson plans or anything and settled on just making shit up in class. Hmm. Another failed experiment, perhaps.
