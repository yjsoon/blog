After an afternoon of fiddling with MySQL export functions and a mess of CSS, I've finally managed to upgrade this site to use [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org). It's quite the improvement over [b2](http://www.cafelog.com), which should be no surprise since it's a follow-up version of the program. Pretty smooth transition thanks to [this site](http://www.wild-mind.net/index.php?p=51)'s instructions. Though one of the lines -- `DROP TABLE wp_settings` -- wasn't applicable to my install (WP1.2). Took it out and everything else worked perfectly in the import. (Edit: To the author at wild-mind.net: Much appreciated for the help, and also in pointing out a textarea problem which went unnoticed on my Firefox browser) Except there was still the resultant mess of incompatible CSS which took me a couple of hours to sort out into the site's present incarnation. There are even three flavours of syndication available for the site now -- [RSS](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/feed/rss), [RSS 2.0](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/feed/rss2) and [ATOM](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/feed/atom). My geekmind boggles. Uh, in case none of that made sense, comments are back up so you can complain about it.
