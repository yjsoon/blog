Or, &#8220;What to do with all the chickens&#8221;. When I'm not drowning in assignments (almost... done... with... Physics... education... essay), I'm considering moving the chicken comics to the front page of this domain, i.e. [www.stupidchicken.com](http://www.stupidchicken.com), and renaming the entire strip to Stupid Chicken to fit the domain name. It'd require a drastic realignment of Chicken's underlying motivations and overall psychological health, but I think we can deal. Maybe in two weeks, when assignment deadlines STOP SHOWING UP AND BITCHSLAPPING ME IN THE FACE EVERY BLOODY DAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Back to your regularly scheduled chickens.
