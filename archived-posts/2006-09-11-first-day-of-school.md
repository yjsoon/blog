It was no easy task dragging myself back to work after nearly two weeks away from the classroom. At the end of the day, I've just about lost my voice, my lesson plans are in disarray, I haven't finished typing the notes I promised the kids two weeks ago, I owe my bosses all kinds of paperwork, the randomly inserted new timetable slots completely messed up my schedule... But there were moments in class today when I managed to make the kids laugh madly at one of my usual absurd examples, drawings or voices. And seeing them -- especially those who were, just barely a week ago, crying their hearts out -- laugh like that, even just for a few seconds, even if they took nothing else away from the lesson, made me glad to be back, and made me glad to be teaching.
