While searching for tennis rackets in the store room today, I came across my portfolio from my (regrettably) only Art class at Stanford -- discounting the animation one, which was mostly MATLAB programming and/or Maya. Naturally, I dug it out (and naturally, everything fell on me).  
  
I was especially looking for this "self-portrait" that we had to do as a final project for the class -- the only requirement being that it had to be life-sized (yes, life-sized for me == problem) and everything else was left open to choice (media, form, etc). I ended up doing a stream-of-consciousness comic strip which, upon consideration three years later, really did reflect me quite well (and probably still does).  
  
Bits of it are embarrassingly silly and self-indulgent, but I can probably live with posting it on this blog (or the [drawings](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/drawings) site). That is, once I figure out how to scan it. Life-sized, remember.  
  
Anyway, I used the good old wocka character from secondary school. Here it\* is, on top of the robot thing. Painted this sophomore or junior year, I think.

\* I've decided it's asexual.  
  
Thinking about it, it's been awfully long since I've really drawn anything, or even done any designs I've really liked. I got a sketch book last year as a birthday present, and I've only used two pages of it; I couldn't for the life of me come up with a single inspired design for the second battalion t-shirt; even my redesigned Stanford Alumni site wasn't up to standard for my clients (though my pride and its occasional ally common sense dictate that mine is definitely better-looking than the old design).  
  
Am I missing anything by forgoing this satisfaction from self-expression and instead seeking simpler-to-derive entertainment such as video games, downloaded TV and movies?  
  
Maybe I should be thankful I have the chance to even raise that question.
