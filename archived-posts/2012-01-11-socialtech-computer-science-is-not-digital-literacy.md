[Jodie Fraser](http://fraser.typepad.com/socialtech/2012/01/compueter-science-is-not-digital-literacy.html):

> Digital literacy means the the skills and confidence to take an active role in engaging in networks, and in shaping and creating opportunities - social, political, cultural, civic, and economic, and we shouldn't be collapsing these broader rights into the relatively narrow concerns of computing science as a curriculum area.

Article via \[Fraser Speirs\](http://fraserspeirs.com) (that's a lot of Frasers). Mildly surprising, to me at least, is his strong support for the argument raised in the link article, given that he's a programmer and Computer Science teacher. This \[piece of his\](http://speirs.org/blog/2011/12/29/three-mantras-from-the-first-two-years.html) on "technology for subjects not traditionally well-served by technology" may serve to explain why, but I'm still trying to digest all of this.
