After a brief\* hiatus from making webcomics, I'm back with old friend and long-time collaborator [EEK](http://twitter.com/eektertainment) to try doing a new comic. It's called [Chicken vs. Chocolate](http://chickochoco.com) or Chickochoco for short, and it stars our trusty old stupid Chicken and a brand new grumpy-as-hell character.

This time, we've actually planned ahead and gotten at least three months' worth of scripts ready, as opposed to how I used to wing it the night before my self-imposed posting deadline. Also, EEK will be handling most of the art while I sit around and pencil in Chicken, which is a pretty sweet deal for me. I hope he doesn't read this.

Anyway, please follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/chickochoco) and Like us on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/chickochoco)! If you already did, please tell your friends, and stay tuned for all manners of madcap adventures.

\* Nearly 3 years, to this day: the last stupidchicken comic was posted on [19 April, 2010](http://stupidchicken.com/comic/2010/04/19/stabsy-says-hi/).
