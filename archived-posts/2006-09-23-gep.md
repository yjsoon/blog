Looks like the Ministry of Education's finally made it official -- no more Gifted Education Programme at the secondary level: [Gifted kids to take 'integrated' path](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/231715/1/.html) (Channelnewsasia.com) [NOW MOE finally slaughters SACRED COW](http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,114216,00.html) (The Electric New Paper) Nothing surprising, apart from the TNP article being bizarrely smug about their &#8220;prediction in 2004&#8221;. Because YELLING CAPITAL LETTERS in your headline makes you SOUND MORE CREDIBLE. What's surprising is that where I teach, the school's shutting down its internal GE programme as well. A pity -- the small class sizes were nice and manageable, and it felt easier to connect with them than the one or two non-GE classes I've taught (granted, I've only taught 9 GE classes vs. 1 mainstream here and 2 elsewhere). Maybe it's my own prejudices at work, but I'm not certain it'll be as easy to amuse the mainstream kids with my nonsense. We'll see, I guess.
