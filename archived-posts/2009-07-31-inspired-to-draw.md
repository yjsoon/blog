I've realised it takes quite a bit of discipline to draw [stupidchicken](http://stupidchicken.com/comic) on a regular basis. Yes, I usually just end up taking existing drawings, making small modifications, adding some senseless text and pretending it's funny. It's still tiring. Be quiet. This last half-year of doing the webcomic has been quite rewarding, though. I've set up a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/stupidchicken/169963835253) for it (factoid: biggest fanbase - teenage girls from the UK. Go figure), and a nice commenter went "love these comics, really make my day, keep it up!". A nice comment! On the Internet! Probably a sarcastic troll. Anyway, thanks, nice commenter or sarcastic troll. I'll keep it up as long as I can. I also found [drearyweary](http://www.drearyweary.com/stories.php) recently. The creator is a Singaporean comic artist who does some really, really amazing work, and he posts entire long (and coherent) comicbooks online (Creative Commons licensed, even). I need to buy some of his stuff, if I can find it. I'm really enjoying The Resident Tourist - it's a (presumably) autobiographical story about the life of a returning Singaporean who feels displaced in his home country. Speaks to me more than a little, I guess. And the crisp art is just awfully impressive. Finally: ![Evil-Tofu](public/images/2009/07/Evil-Tofu.png) Evil Tofu is a character from the webcomic, who showed up [here](http://stupidchicken.com/comic/2009/04/27/fear-the-evil-tofu/) and [here](http://stupidchicken.com/comic/2009/05/10/fear-the-wobbly-tofu/). Drawn for Toru, my evil friend who's in Nairobi or Narnia or something.
