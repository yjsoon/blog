How to tell when poker night's gone on for _way_ too long: while driving home, I saw quite a number of people doing their morning jogs. Not nearly as bad as in my final quarter at school, when the fast food morning staff recognised my group at the drive-through because we'd always be programming till dawn then getting hungry, but... close enough. Two more weeks of this nonsensical life-schedule before I go to &#8220;school&#8221; (or work, loosely defined), though. Making the most out of it, I suppose.
