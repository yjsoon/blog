Republished from [Medium](https://medium.com/@yjsoon/the-company-we-keep-c5c2eec16b33).

After I left a five-year stint in the Ministry of Education, I started [Tinkertanker](http://tinkertanker.com/) in 2011 with two of my closest friends.

We created our very first invoice for teaching a programming class, did some software consulting, made a&nbsp;[couple](http://icphoto.tinkertanker.com/)&nbsp;of&nbsp;[apps](http://guestday.com/), hired our first full-timers, started teaching a boatload\* of programming classes, started an&nbsp;[online store](http://gethacking.com/), hired a boatload\* of technical interns, worked with&nbsp;[IMDA](http://www.imda.gov.sg/)&nbsp;on projects, exhibited at events, designed some hardware, and now we can't describe what we do in a sentence any more.

So we're starting a blog:

"¦ where we get to adapt all these emails and blurbs we've written about the company over the years into something we can share. Take a look, and&nbsp;[let us know](mailto:hello@tinkertanker.com)&nbsp;if you have any feedback, want to work with us, or know anyone awesome we can work with.

\* Boatload because "tanker", get it, get it,&nbsp;_hur hur hur_
