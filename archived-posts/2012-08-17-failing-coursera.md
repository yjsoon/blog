Tim Owens, on ["failing" Coursera courses](http://www.timmmmyboy.com/2012/08/failing-coursera/):

> For much of the course I felt like a bystander. Here I was watching a set of videos chosen by my professor. I may or may not have a quiz at the end of the week to gauge my learning. The videos were interesting, but I left feeling like I hadn't participated. \["Â¦\] I can't tell you the name of a single other person that was in this course and it started with over 40,000. I think that's a shame and something they could improve on.

I've yet to pass a single [Coursera](http://[Coursera]\(http://coursera.org\)) course myself--I've "failed" Algorithms and HCI so far. However, I do feel like I've really learned something from the parts of the courses I've taken, and I appreciate how Coursera and other \[MOOCs\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive\_open\_online\_course) (what a great name) have encouraged all these subject matter experts to curate and present all this useful information in brief, easily digestible chunks for teachers and students.
