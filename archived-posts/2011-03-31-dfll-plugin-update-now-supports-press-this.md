\### The Boring Backstory On Tuesday, I read about Justin Blanton's \[Slugger+\](http://hypertext.net/projects/sluggerplus) WordPress plugin, which allows you to set your \[post slug\](http://wordpress.org/tags/post-slug) by entering your desired slug enclosed in \`\[slug\]\` tags, e.g. \`\[slug\]this-is-my-slug\[/slug\]\`. I wondered if I could adapt my \[Daring Fireball Linked List plugin\](http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin) to do the same, i.e. if someone entered, \`\[dfll\]http://yjsoon.com\[/dfll\]\` somewhere in their post, the plugin could find the URL and set the custom field link to it. So I tried implementing this, and I was stalled when I \[ran into a problem\](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/adding-a-custom-field-from-content\_save\_pre-filter-through-xmlrpc?replies=2). Apart from posting it on the WP forums, I emailed Justin to see if he had any ideas. Coincidentally, he had been working on the same feature, and he'd also run into the same problem! I went off for work, and a few hours later, Justin emailed to say he'd solved the problem, and he released his \[CF Setter\](http://hypertext.net/projects/cfsetter) plugin the next day. After CF Setter was released, I decided not to replicate its functionality in my plugin. (If you'd like to use that feature, go take a look -- you just need some minor adjustments to get it to work with my plugin.) Instead, I thought I'd try and adapt Justin's code to solve another problem: posting using WordPress's built-in "\[Press This\](http://codex.wordpress.org/Press\_This)" bookmarklet. \[Shawn Blanc\](http://shawnblanc.net/2009/08/wp-linked-list-plugin/) had put up a customised version of the bookmarklet's code a while ago, but I was never comfortable with editing core files, what with automatic upgrades and all. ### New Coolness: Link from Post Content So, long story long, a few hours and a lot of painful regular expression writing later, the \[new DFLL plugin\](http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin) supports "Press This" by extracting the link from the first anchor tag in the post content. Here's how you use it: First, turn on the setting in the options page. Next, on any page you'd like to link to, just click the "Press This" bookmarklet, and the following will pop up: ![Screen shot 2011 03 31 at PM 08 15 13](public/images/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-PM-08.15.13.png) Click on the end of the first line, press enter (\_be careful not to delete the period!\_), and type whatever comments you'd like. The plugin will automatically \_\_grab the URL in the first line\_\_, \_\_set it to the linked\\\_list\\\_url custom field\_\_, and \_\_delete the entire first line\_\_ for you, preserving whatever you've entered into the rest of the post content. Ta-da! Linked list item! If you'd like to use this with the \[MarsEdit\](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) bookmarklet, you can customise the Attribution preference as follows: ![Screen shot 2011 03 31 at PM 08 25 09](public/images/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-PM-08.25.09.png) More details are on the \[DFLL plugin\](http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin) page, which I've linked to thrice already in this post. Many thanks to Justin Blanton for his plugins which both inspired and laid the foundations for this feature. Questions and comments?
