Remember I was [compraining](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/archives/2005/08/13/comprain-comprain) about how my NIE tutor for Communication Skills couldn't pronounce the letter 'h' correctly the other day? (She'd pronounced it &#8220;hedge&#8221; on several occasions, annoying me to no end.) So during today's class on phonetics, this same tutor showed two pronunciations of the letter 'h' on the board -- 'hedge' and 'aych' -- then proceeded to explain that the latter was the correct pronunciation. Wait, what?! She knows the right pronunciation? Of course she would, she teaches communication skills. In fact, she explained it like this (I paraphrase): &#8220;So remember, class: the letter hedge is pronounced without a hedge in front.&#8221; Whu?!? Oh my poor exploding brain.
