I've had an iPad for about three weeks now (thanks to two Kevins for bringing back the iPad and case). ![photo 1.PNG](public/images/2010/05/photo-1.png) I've noticed that, despite the \[69 million reviews\](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ipad+review&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) already out there, anyone who gets hold of one feels the need to write about his initial thoughts on the device. Ick! Such self-absorbed twats! Anyway, my initial thoughts on the device: \* It's been great for reading a variety of things on. I've been plowing through articles on Instapaper, PDFs on GoodReader, and books on iBooks. \* Other apps - NewsRack for RSS, Twitterrific for Twitter, SimpleNote for note-taking, ArtStudio for finger-painting, NYT and BBC for news, PenUltimate for quick sketches. So far so good. All these apps are very distracting when I want to settle down and read, though. (Multitasking in OS 4 will probably destroy my attention span for good.) \* GoodReader could do with an icon that doesn't remind me of the eye of Sauron. \* Hasn't replaced my laptop yet. However, doesn't burn my lap when watching videos in bed. (To convert, erm, non-iTunes TV and movie content, I bought \[iFlicks\](http://www.iflicksapp.com/), which converts videos into iTunes-compatible formats, downloads cover art and fills in episode info.) \* One complaint, I guess - the iPad's screen could do with greater pixel density. I keep noticing jaggies while reading text. Summary: love it. As Stephen Fry wrote in his \[giddy TIME review\](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1976935,00.html), the iPad is truly the closest thing to the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy humankind has devised. Douglas Adams would have been proud. (Wallpaper from talented Apple designer \[Louie Mantia\](http://mantia.me/wallpaper).)
