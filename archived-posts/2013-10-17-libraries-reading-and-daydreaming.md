[Neil Gaiman on reading](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming):

> Also, do not do what this author did when his 11-year-old daughter was into RL Stine, which is to go and get a copy of Stephen King's Carrie, saying if you liked those you'll love this! Holly read nothing but safe stories of settlers on prairies for the rest of her teenage years, and still glares at me when Stephen King's name is mentioned.

(There were many more important, but less hilarious, bits than this quote.)
