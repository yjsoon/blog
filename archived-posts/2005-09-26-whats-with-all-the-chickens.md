Anyone reading this blog might have noticed how, completely unannounced, I dropped all semblance of blog-like behaviour from this site last week and threw online all kinds of index card drawings instead. Fairly simple reason: I'm tired of writing. After that 3000-word pile of festering crap that was my Educational Psychology essay, followed immediately by a few painfully excreted multi-page project reports (excuse the imagery), not to mention the countless essays due in the next month or so, I'd really rather not have to deal with words and grammar and sentence structure\* and other such fuzziness for a while. On the other hand, since I'm usually bored out of my mind in my NIE classes (my Physics and Math courses have succeeded in convincing me that I really, _really_ don't want to teach those subjects so I need to find a school that's looking for Computer Science teachers), all I need are my black pen and some index cards to entertain myself for a few precious minutes that could save me from permanent brain damage. So, yes, that's it. Now I post another chicken comic. \* Not that I usually do.
