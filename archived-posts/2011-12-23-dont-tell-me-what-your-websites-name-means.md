If your website's name doesn't make immediate sense, and you don't have a good explanation for it, \_please\_ don't tell me how you came up with it. Here are two websites with decently cool-sounding names, until you read why they chose these names:- Asian tech news site \[Penn Olson\](http://www.penn-olson.com/about-us/): > Starting the blog with just a few people was tough, so when we considered a name, we liked the idea of having some mythical partners to guide us on our journey. We created Penn-Olson, because blogging is essentially "˜penning ones thoughts' and "˜Olson' was a somewhat arbitrary addition, but it sounded (like) awesome. I like what they do as a news site, but this paragraph just takes all the mystique from their name and throws it in the laundry. \[\_\_Update\_\_: Someone told me a few days later this para is gone. Good for them!\] Classifieds site \[ST701\](http://www.st701.com/aboutus.html): > ST701 carries the initials of The Straits Times. The numbers "701" convey what the user will experience: 7 days a week search at the 01 place that matters. The user will "experience" search \_seven whole days a week\_, guys!\* At the \_zero-one place that matters\_! Thanks, ST701, now my forehead is sore from all that self-inflicted slapping. Yes, this was written by someone who calls his company \[Tinkertanker\](http://tinkertanker.com). No, I'm not saying how we came up with that name. (Yes, that means we don't have a good explanation for it.) \\\* I guess that's better than a \[social media account\](http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/smrt-lot-more-learn-social-media-063406182.html) that, until recently, ran Mondays to Fridays, 9am-6pm, excluding public holidays.
