From the blog behind the "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" book:

> "\[For\] the casually interested or schoolchildren with several activities competing for their attention, programming concepts like variables and loops and data types aren't interesting in themselves. They don't want to learn how to program just for the sake of programming. They don't want to learn about algorithm complexity or implicit casting. They want to make Super Mario or Twitter or Angry Birds."

We've actually found that our students are usually quite happy to spend lots of time making silly console-output programs, like printing a pyramid of asterisks. However, the intro programming courses we've conducted have been for a fairly self-selected bunch. The book is available \[online\](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/) for free, and it certainly looks like a great instructional resource.
