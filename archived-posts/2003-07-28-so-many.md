so many goodbyes to say. i didn't think it was going to be extraordinarily easy, but it's harder to accept than i thought... still, time marches on, much like i will in the army (well, not quite like i will, since time doesnt fall out to complain about being tired).  
  
i don't know how many of you will ever read this, but to all you crazy stanford weirdos: cheers, it's been good times. i hope we meet again. drop me a line when you earn money and can go jetsetting around the world, please visit then. however, please don't earn money until two years later when i'm done with the army.  
  
and to all you other weirdtards who're back already, i'll see you when i get home in a couple of days. it's been too long.  
  
or not long enough at all.
