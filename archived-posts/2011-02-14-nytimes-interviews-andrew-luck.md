I found [this line](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/sports/ncaafootball/13luck.html) by Luck terribly amusing:

> Luck's ultimate insurance will come from his Stanford degree, and he plans to graduate next spring. "I'll look like an idiot if I didn't,"¬ù he said with a laugh.

What a guy, and what a season. I'm glad I managed to catch some of their games online. (Albeit through questionable means -- I would have been happy to have paid to watch the Orange Bowl online, but I couldn't find a single legit source that streamed internationally.)
