Term ends in a week and a half. This Friday, I meet my classes for the last time for "reflection and review" (comically abbreviated as "R & R" on the timetable), and then I just need to go for some closing dinners, write some reports, supervise a camp, attend some meetings and hand things over to my unlucky successors... and then I'll be done here. Holy shit. That's way too soon. I need to thwack a few more misbehaving students on the head with my large plastic file, or else I'll leave here with a severe sense of underachievement.  I'll probably do some "R & R" of my own on my brief teaching stint here at some point (summary: I don't think I could have had a better first posting), but for now, I need to find me some students to thwack.
