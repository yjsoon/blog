Today, I received a letter from Maybank about a credit card application I made. It said my credit card application couldn't be completed, and asked me to send documentary "proof of residence", i.e. a bill or a bank statement with my address indicated. I thought about this for a second. The bank \_\_mailed a letter to my address\_\_, asking me to send something to \_\_prove that I'm staying at this same address I received their letter at\_\_. What?! So I'll be sending this back to them:- ![Photo](public/images/2011/03/photo.jpg) I suppose I won't be getting this card after all. Ah well.
