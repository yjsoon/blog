Stumbled across this Ars Technica [report](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070402-mpaa-names-its-top-25-movie-piracy-schools.html) on the MPAA's newly-released list of top 25 movie piracy schools. On the list:

> 24\. Stanford University - 405 25. University of California at Berkeley - 398

Alright! Way to make up for years of losing Big Game. Respect. Also,

> A number of schools have the dubious distinction of being on both the MPAA and the RIAA list. The overachievers are: Ohio University (#1 RIAA/#18 MPAA), Purdue University (#2, #5), University of Nebraska at Lincoln (#3/#13), UMASS (#6/#9), Michigan State (#7/#20), North Carolina State (#9/#14), University of South Florida (#11/#23), Boston University (#15/#3), and the University of Michigan (#18/#10).

Am I the only one who thinks that list reads like a NCAA sports ranking list, with AP ranking followed by USA Today ranking? For that matter, why can't piracy be a NCAA sport?
