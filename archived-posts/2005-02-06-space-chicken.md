So I thought: the year of the rooster is coming up, and this is stupidchicken.com, so I should probably draw something to usher in the new year. Umm. Actually, I got distracted while trying to do some real design work -- sorry ML. Anyway, in the same vein as [this painting](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/drawings/wock-painting-large.jpg), here's a space chicken in time for the new year. [![Space Chicken](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/cny.jpg "Space Chicken")](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/cny.jpg) Done in pencil and Photoshop. Click on the picture for the full 600x917 version. Having finally drawn something, that takes care of one of my new year [to-do](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/archives/2004/12/29/2004-out) items. Furthermore, while writing this, a friend just sent me an email from Republic Poly about how they're looking for fresh graduates to lecture in their EE/CS department -- worth a shot, I think (thanks Gail!). My, aren't we moving along.
