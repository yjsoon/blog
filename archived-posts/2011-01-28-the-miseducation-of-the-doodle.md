Sunni Brown on doodling at \[A List Apart\](https://alistapart.com/article/the-miseducation-of-the-doodle):

> Doodling may be better described as "˜markings to help a person think.'

The act of doodling is the mind's attempt to engage before succumbing to mindlessness.

She goes on to explain why one should engage in "strategic doodling" at work, and introduces a basic doodle vocabulary for people who think they can't draw. Excellent stuff.
