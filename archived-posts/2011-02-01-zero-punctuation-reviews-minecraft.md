There is no game reviewer I trust more than ZP. He's especially good in this one, but pardon the Flash video (yes, again with Flash, sigh). I went and bought \[Minecraft\](http://minecraft.net) shortly after watching this review (also after hearing countless other positive reviews on Twitter). Thankfully, I'm not addicted... yet.
