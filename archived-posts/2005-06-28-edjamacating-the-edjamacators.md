So the one(ish -- I didn't have any classes last Tuesday and Thursday) week in NIE is over, and I've been bored out of my mind so much that I've racked up 3MB of GPRS usage surfing the web, checking email and using instant messaging (AIM/ICQ/MSN) services on the cellphone while in class. The instructors seem nice enough and really do teach rather well, but they don't seem to have very much interesting subject matter to work with. Next stop: four-week &#8220;Teaching Experience&#8221; in school. The Teacher Training Unit apparently decided it'd be amusing to post me to the school my dad teaches at. Very funny, guys. Can't complain, though... free ride to work in the morning, and it's only a few bus stops away, anyway, so I can rush home quickly. Since we look nothing alike, my dad and I have decided not to tell anyone about the connection (though it'd seem mighty suspicious for anyone noticing me driving my dad's car off every now and then). Nothing worth complaining about. Ask me again in a month (fuckin' flag day for NIE orientation?! Fuck!).
