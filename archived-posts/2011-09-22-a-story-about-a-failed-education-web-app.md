The [story](http://blog.studiofellow.com/2011/09/21/reboot-relaunch-redesign-pivot-sunset-shutter-the-knack-a-web-app-story/) of someone spending a year building, selling and giving up on \[Knack\](http://knackforteachers.com/), an online grade book for teachers. Some interesting lessons learnt, including this part about why his app failed:

> Teachers say they love tech. Some blog about it. They tweet about it in #edchat and #edtech. They even coin their own special tech terms. This is a farce. Talking about tech and being on \_the Twitter\_ make teachers look good to administrators and to the public. They can add "Technology Committee Member"¬ù to their resumes and congratulate themselves for being innovative. But using tech to do work requires a small minimum of effort and change, and any amount of these is too much for teachers.

Overly harsh, but true\*. There's a good debate about this on the \[Hacker News thread\](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3024147), where the writer clarifies what he meant in a comment: that he'd made a mistake assuming teachers would pay for a tool that they had to spend time acclimatising to. \\\* I say this as a former "Technology Committee Member" and a current app developer. By the way, tech posts are generally cross-posted to the \[company blog\](http://tinkertanker.tumblr.com), along with pictures and videos of us \[doing stupid things\](http://tinkertanker.tumblr.com/post/10272286361/tinkertanker-exercise-day).
