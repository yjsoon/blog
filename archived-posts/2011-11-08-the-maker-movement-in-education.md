[An interview with Dale Dougherty](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/11/dale-dougherty-make-white-house.html), co-founder of O'Reilly Media and \[MAKE magazine\](http://makezine.com). Tim O'Reilly sums it up:

> "When you see kids at Maker Faire suddenly turned on to science and math because they want to make things, when you see them dragging their parents around with eyes shining, you realize just how dull our education system has made some of the most exciting and interesting stuff in the world.

Dougherty explains in detail the promise of the maker movement in education (and government). Pretty inspiring.
