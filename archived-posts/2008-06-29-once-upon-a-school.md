Dave Eggers, TED Prize 2008 winner, on [making a difference in the classroom](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dave_eggers_makes_his_ted_prize_wish_once_upon_a_school.html). Very inspirational.

> You can do and use the skills that you have. The schools need you. The teachers need you. Students and parents need you. They need your actual person. Your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion. Sitting next to them, listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time. Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are. How smart and how much they have to say. You can tell them. You can shine that light on them one human interaction at a time.

I'm moving on to a new posting in January, and I have strong suspicions these next few months will be my final times as a professional teacher. Even so, I'm not quite sure I'm done teaching yet, so I'm just making a mental note here to revisit this video a year down the road. Once Upon A School, Mr. Egger's challenge for adults to support their local schools, is [here](http://onceuponaschool.org/).
