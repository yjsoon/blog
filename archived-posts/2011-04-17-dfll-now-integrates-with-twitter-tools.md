...or, another edition of "OMG SHUT UP WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR STUPID PLUGIN!!!!1". Anyway, I've updated the \[DF Linked List WordPress plugin\](http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin) again: \* Fixed RSS feed validation. Many thanks to \[Michael Camilleri\](http://inqk.net) for pointing this out and pushing a fix! Getting to discover blogs like \[his\](http://inqk.net/weblog) is one of those happy unintended results of having written this plugin. \* Added \[Twitter Tools\](http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-tools/) integration. Now you can add a glyph in front of tweets that link to non-linked-list posts, just like how Gruber does it for the \[DF Twitter account\](http://twitter.com/daringfireball). In addition, you can also add a glyph or text (e.g. "Link:") in front of linked list item tweets. Thanks to \[Ben Brooks\](http://brooksreview.net) for the suggestion on this one.
