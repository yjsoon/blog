Well done to [Wireless@SG](http://www.infocomm123.sg/wireless_at_sg) for successfully messing up my [Safari Top Sites](http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#topsites): ![Screen shot 2010-02-15 at PM 06.50.46.PNG](public/images/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-02-15-at-PM-06.50.46.png) The new Wireless@SGx (dubbed "SSA", which stands for "Seamless and Secure Access", or "Senseless and Stupid Acronym") 802.1X-enabled hotspot service is nice though, and really does help to solve this problem - after you set it up, you don't have to go through the above login page. Thoroughly recommended for iPhone users especially. Search for one of the three mysteriously-differently-branded-but-functionally-identical Wireless@SG on the App Store and follow the instructions to download and configure the necessary security certificates.
