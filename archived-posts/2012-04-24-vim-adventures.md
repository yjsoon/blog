[An interactive web game to help you become familiar with Vim commands](http://vim-adventures.com/). Very nicely done! I found it a little frustrating to get through because I know the basics, but the player is made to "unlock" commands such as w and b. Worse, the first "maze" you navigate with hjkl encourages you to mash those buttons (can't put a number in front to repeat commands). That said, though, very fun and great production values. "YIPPEE", as they say.
