An interesting argument: that calculating devices are now ubiquitous, and math should focus on computational problem-solving instead of drilling and memorisation. [An example the author cites](http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/02/22/21mccreight.h31.html?tkn=MSTFlM06cYBltWjB6VF%2FuCclUPaeg7zRrUeI&cmp=clp-edweek):

> Computer languages allow students to transform ideas into action. Here is a simple rule that a math teacher might describe to her students:  
> If the number is greater than 9, carry the 10's place; otherwise add the number to the bottom row.

The solution for this can be expressed as an if/else statement:

if number > 9:  
  carry += number / 10  
else:  
  bottom += number

There are, as expected, plenty of opposing views in the comments, but it's good food for thought. Also noteworthy: the comments aren't completely stupid. Not-completely-stupid comments! On the Internet! WHAT IS THIS WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN
