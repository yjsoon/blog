I tried syncing my iPhone yesterday, and got an "unable to sync, error 13019" error message. Some quick googling landed me on this Apple support page ([Error 13019 during sync](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2830)), which recommended de-selecting syncing voice memos and trying to sync again. If that failed (yup), de-select syncing music to try again (failed). Then videos, podcasts, etc. until a successful sync could be performed. All of this failed, so the page recommended I "attempt to sync an empty iTunes music library to the device while logged in as a new admin user". Ugh! No! **What eventually worked for me**: looking through the Voice Memos app, finding 8 of the same voice memo, deleting them all then syncing. Hmph.
