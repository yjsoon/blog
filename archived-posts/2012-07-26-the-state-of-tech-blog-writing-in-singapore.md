Posting without comment; emphasis mine. e27, \[Electronic Arts merges IronMonkey and Firemint to form Australia's largest gaming studio Firemonkeys \](http://e27.sg/2012/07/25/electronic-arts-merges-ironmonkey-and-firemint-to-form-australias-largest-gaming-studio-firemonkeys/), 25 July 2012:

> Good news aside, there are certainly expectations from the gaming community for the new Firemonkeys to perform, as **they now eagerly awaits** their first product.

That's it, for now. I might do more of these, if I get annoyed enough. Oh, here's one more. In this case, the bad grammar and awkward phrasing aren't necessarily the writer's fault. e27, \[The Demise of QR Codes\](http://e27.sg/2012/02/28/the-demise-of-qr-codes/), February 2012:

> QR codes will remain a curious oddity for the technically proficient geeks and bleeding adopters.

Here are the \[search results\](http://google.com/search?q=bleeding%20adopters) for the odd term "bleeding adopters". Compare \[this article\](http://www.imediaconnection.com/printpage/printpage.aspx?id=30267) from October 2011, which also contains that phrase, to the above e27 article. _Update_, a day later: e27 and Tech in Asia have acknowledged and corrected the above. Both note that they appreciate error reports sent through their comment sections.
