It's part of a teaser graphic I've been doing for an organisation's events. ![Podcast](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/podcast.png) The wocka's an old character I've been using on and off for more than a decade... some old stuff [here](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/archives/2005/02/06/space-chicken) (2005), [here](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/drawings/wock-painting-large.jpg) (2002, I think), and [here](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/drawings/wockgun.gif) (1999?).
