You might have already seen this, since \[mrbrown\](http://mrbrown.com) linked to it on Twitter. Posting on the blog for posterity anyway: ![Lolcat9dce5677436502d890d6d7281964d0c7b8ffcb58](public/images/2011/05/lolcat9dce5677436502d890d6d7281964d0c7b8ffcb58.jpg) It's been a lifelong\* ambition of mine to get a \[LOLcat\](http://icanhascheezburger.com) picture published\*\*, but this will have to do for now. \\\* \_Mild\_ exaggeration. \\\*\* This may or may not have influenced how much I supported Joey when she adopted our ridiculous cat. Shh, don't tell her.
