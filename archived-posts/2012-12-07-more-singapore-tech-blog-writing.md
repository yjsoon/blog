From a recent e27 article, \[Google launches products to encourage entrepreneurship in the emerging markets\](http://e27.sg/2012/12/06/google-launches-products-to-encourage-entrepreneurship-in-the-emerging-markets/): > Relying on citizen cartographers, Google Map Maker started in India as a way to make better maps of the subcontinent. It is a form of crowdsourcing that has emerged that demonstrates an effective way of getting local content online. Today, the product has doubled the worlds digital maps corpus, mapping 1.5 billion people in 187 countries. The UN and aid agencies have used these user generated maps to assist and rescue millions. I found the last two sentences of this paragraph notable because (a) they were much less clumsily written than the rest of the article, and (b) "corpus"?! Who the hell actually uses that word? So, as a former teacher who's marked his fair share of suspicious-looking student reports, I googled. From \[Global Innovation Roundtable's bio of Lalitesh Katragadda\](http://globalinnovationroundtable.gov.in/speakers/lalitesh-katragadda.html): > His most recent creation, Google Map Maker, doubled the worlds digital maps corpus, mapping 1.5 billion people in 187 countries. The UN and aid agencies have used these user generated maps to assist and rescue millions. Even the missing apostrophe made it over. Lesson: Don't plagiarise in a world with Google. Especially not in an article about Google. (The first sentence in the quote is also copied, but a little better"‚Äùat least there, the author makes an effort to paraphrase parts of para 3 in \[Google's blog entry\](http://googleindia.blogspot.tw/2012/12/the-next-billion-internet-users.html).)
