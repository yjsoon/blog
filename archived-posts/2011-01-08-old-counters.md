I received an email from Facebook a couple of weeks ago, telling me to update my Facebook apps (\[Bond Counter\](http://apps.facebook.com/bondcounter) and \[NS Counter\](http://apps.facebook.com/nscounter)) because they called some functions which would be deprecated. I haven't been keeping track of developments in the Facebook API, but looking through the changes, I realise Facebook is no longer allowing apps to put themselves on user profiles as little boxes. This move makes sense given the new profile, but renders my apps slightly useless, because they were intended to show off your counters to the world. I put off making any changes until today, which is apparently the deadline for any changes, because (a) there are too many other more interesting things to work on right now, and (b) I \_really\_ don't like looking at my old code. I was even tempted to just pull the plug on the two apps, but then I saw that each still has "monthly users" (20 for Bond Counter, 150 for NS Counter), whatever that means. So now the two apps are severely crippled -- you can see your bond/NS counter from your own app page, and you can still compare counters with friends, but that's about it. I don't have the time to figure out how to do an application tab, which is apparently the wall box replacement, but this is good enough for anyone who really still uses these apps. I also realise now I didn't write about my bond having ended in August! Well, it did, and I no longer need Bond Counter. Making this little app, and seeing it spread, was really one of the highlights of my indentured service, though.
