Some Things To Mention In Point Form.

*   Going to start posting comics on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yjsoon/tags/stupidchicken/) as well. Go there for high-resolution (rather, super grainy) versions.
*   Related to above, from the left side of the page: "You're the only person who has used "stupidchicken" as a tag." YEAH I'M SO ORIGINAL WOO
*   The comics-only page is now accessible at [comics.stupidchicken.com](http://comic.stupidchicken.com).
*   Sooner or later I will make a comics-only blog.
*   (Bet on later.)
*   Recent turn of events have made me so annoyed I can't even begin to describe how much I want to kick a small animal or two right now.

That is all.
