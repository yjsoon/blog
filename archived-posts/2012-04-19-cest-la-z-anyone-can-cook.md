Mike Zamansky on the recent spate of online programming education offerings, specifically the more "vocational" ones such as Codecademy:

This post articulates the fear I've been having about trying to make programming more accessible to everyone: to what end? For users, is there any value in this knowledge? (Conversely, though, what's the value in learning basic science and humanities for "users", i.e. people existing in the physical world and society?)
