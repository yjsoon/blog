It's been at least four years since I've had to write 12-page fuzzy papers. As it stands, I have 24 hours to write this damn thing on &#8220;creative and critical thinking&#8221;, and I'm out of practice from my days of being able to generate a page of reasonably intelligible nonsense every hour. Also, I've only written one page in the last four days. Ooh, the excitement! It's been so long since I've had so much fun procrastinating and then having to regret it on the day before an assignment is due.
