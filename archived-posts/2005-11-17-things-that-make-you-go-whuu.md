I haven't done the whole linking-around thing for a while, so...

*   [MPAA equates pirated DVDs to drugs on the street](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051115-5580.html): Not forgetting terrorism, too. And making babies cry by poking their eyes. Damn you, heartless pirates!! \[Ars Technica\]
*   [Wipeout](http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/11/16/wipeout.html): On a related note, some local blogger takes the moral high ground on piracy... unfortunately, he has my name. Damn you, name-stealing moraliser!! (Thanks to Tucque for pointing this out) \[Tomorrow.sg\]
*   [Taking down Army-related posts and pictures](http://miyagi.sg/?p=192): Local blogger faces MINDEATH sanctions on blogging about NS. Really rather ridiculous, I feel. I liked our men in green (umm, uncomfortable-looking khaki office wear?) better when they were running Windows 95 and generally harmless and ineffectual online. \[Miyagi.sg\]
*   [What are we going to do now?, redux](http://www.toomanythoughts.org/blog/2005/11/what-are-we-going-to-do-now-redux.html): A teacher's resignation, and a good read. Not offering my thoughts on this one (you can probably guess). And no, this didn't make me go whuu?!. \[Tym Blogs Too\]

That is all. Chicken returns sometime this week, I promise.
