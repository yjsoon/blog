[A look at how one high school is introducing programming into all its classes](http://mashable.com/2013/09/22/coding-curriculum/?utm_medium=feed&utm_source=rss), even unrelated subjects. Some of these are eyebrow-raise-worthy at first glance:

> Brown says she's considering a poetry unit using code language. \[...\] Tina Farrell, who heads the Performing Arts department, is interested in experimenting with live-coding performances, where students would use software to compose and perform music with scripts they write.

But just \_imagine\_ if these worked. Also, new to me, linked from the article: \[TurtleBits\](http://turtlebits.net/), an interactive turtle learning tool. Still one of my favourite intro programming resources.
