That's what my comment spam just told me.

Three months is an awful long time to spend feeling sorry for yourself, right? I'm back, as soon as I get over this inconveniently-timed bout of weekend flu. In the meantime, I'm on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/yjsoon), just like half a million other new signups.

Besides, if I don't bother posting again, I can claim this was just an April Fool's special.
