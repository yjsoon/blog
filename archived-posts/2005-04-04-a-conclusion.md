I had a long post with a lot to say about my NSF &#8220;career&#8221; as a whole, but it really wasn't very interesting. Long story short: Friday was my last working day as a NSF. In all likelihood, however, I'll have to go back at some point. Probably a result of one of the following scenarios: (a) my understudy panics and doesn't know how to do something because I really didn't spend much time teaching him, (b) my boss realises this, decides he'd rather have me do something for him than my understudy, and calls me back to do it, (c) they realise I haven't cleared my IPPT and SOC yet, my window didn't really close, just that I'd deleted my name from the nominal rolls, or (d) someone (e.g. CO, ATEC chief clerk, FO team) realises that I'd yet to complete whatever I was supposed to for them before I fled camp. Meanwhile, I've given the camp number, and any other potentially threatening work-related numbers, silent ring-tones on my mobile phone. This last week, I was told I would be the primary MC for yet another parade, coincidentally on my last day (Friday). Fine, I thought, it's my last week, I can handle this. Next, my backup MC wormed his way out of helping out with announcing for the post-parade reception, so I had to stay till 8 on Friday evening announcing for the whole damn thing. Fine, I thought, it's my last day, I can handle this. At some point, I realised, _no I bloody couldn't_ -- Friday night was important. Aaackk. Fine, fine, it might last till 8, things could be postponed no matter how important they were, they could keep me till 8 and no longer because it'd be my last day. The reception ended before 7, thankfully. I think Friday night went reasonably well, despite my generally harried state. I'm done. Done!
