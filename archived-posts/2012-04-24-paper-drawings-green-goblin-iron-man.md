A couple more. Waiting for my new styluses (styli? steezes?) to arrive before I continue sketching, since the wife has commandeered mine for Draw Something. ![Green Goblin](public/images/2012/04/greengoblin.png) ![Iron Man](public/images/2012/04/IronMan.png) On the second drawing: man, Kirby crackle is \_tough\_ to do on Paper.
