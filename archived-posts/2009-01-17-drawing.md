I managed to rush out today's new stupidchicken comic only an hour before my self-imposed deadline. I imagine this will become more common as work gets busier, but I'm glad this Wednesday-Saturday update schedule is forcing me to be disciplined about drawing regularly.  New chickens since the last update (also, you can subscribe to stupidchicken by [email](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=2749252&loc=en_US) or [RSS](http://stupidchicken.com/comic/feed/)!):

![nothing-to-draw1](public/images/2009/01/nothing-to-draw1.png) Before the internet grew up and ate all my free time, I doodled a lot. I bought reams of white A4 paper, laid on the floor, drew with my cheap fountain pen while dreaming up all kinds of ridiculous story arcs, left my drawings all over the house, and got yelled by my mom who threw away the drawings. This sequence, repeated regularly until I enlisted, made me happy. I even entertained thoughts of drawing and making comics for a living, half-aware that I really didn't have the talent or patience for it. At 19, I was being interviewed by the Public Service Commission for the scholarship (in engineering -- math is easier than art, after all), and they asked what I would like to be doing in ten years' time. I told them, all earnest and naive, that I'd really like to be drawing comics. I can't remember what their reaction was -- maybe I couldn't see their bewilderment through my nervousness -- but I remember my scholarship officer mentioning a year later that she had heard about it, and found it funny. Seemed to me it had gone around the office that _some kid had dared to tell the PSC he wanted to draw comics! Not serve the public good! Just wait till he comes back and serves his bond!_ So now, it's ten years later, and I really want to draw some comics so I can tell the 19-year-old version of me that I didn't mess up his dreams too badly.  ![wocka1](public/images/2009/01/wocka1.png) Also, I spent $500 on my new tablet, so I'd better use the hell out of it.
