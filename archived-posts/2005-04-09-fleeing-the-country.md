The plans are set: April 23 through May 17, I'll be in San Francisco and the Bay Area, and will be staying (at least initially) at Sasank and Toru's apartment in the city. There's something about going to Vegas one of those weekends, but I obviously didn't bother to pay attention when someone in the drawgroup emailed about it (hell, I think they've already booked a flight for me). After that, stopover in Korea on my way back May 18, with another flight to Jeju island 20th to 22nd. Back on Vesak Day. I will be so tired and broke at the end of it, so I do wonder why I'm spending all this money (easily my first month's salary) when I could be sitting at home and relaxing. I should be looking forward to the trip so much more than this -- I'm absolutely certain I was desperate to go at some point -- but right now, I'm not sure what to feel. The last year and three quarters of NSF life haven't really been the painful ordeal (nor even the dull grey monotony) I'd imagined the worst of before I came back. Then again, having been trapped in endless office politicking among NSFs (with the corresponding cap in maturity level -- I'm trying not to be mean, but it's the most succinct description of the situation) while handling oft-unreasonable bossly demands, thinking to myself how ominously well this would serve as a prelude to _real_ working life... I think I need this trip much more than I know, before I plunge into my life of grudgingly acceptable indentured civil service labour. Maybe I'm thinking too much. Who wants me to bring anything back (that won't get me arrested)?
