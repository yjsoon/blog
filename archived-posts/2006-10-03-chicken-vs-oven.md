So I was scanning through [chicken news](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&btnG=Search+News&q=chicken) (my usual source of inspiration), and came across this headline: [Chicken catches fire in grocery oven](http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/1002brk-chicken-ON.html) ... and I actually thought to myself: _That's dumb, why would anyone put a chicken in an oven?!_ My poor brain. I think I'm overworked. ![Chickenvsoven](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/chickenvsoven.png) Previous: [Chicken vs Dogcow](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/archives/2006/08/15/chicken-vs-dogcow) Info: [What's with all the chicken comics?](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/archives/2005/10/12/whats-with-all-the-chickens-part-2)
