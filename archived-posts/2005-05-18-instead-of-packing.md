No, not going home yet -- stopping over in Korea for five days before finally making it back to Singapore on Monday. I do leave from SFO in about eight hours, though, and I'm tired of packing so I'll blog a little. What's gone on since the last post: Went with Tansuwan to [Castle Rock State Park](http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/castlerock.html) in the South Bay for a 4.7 mile hike. Reading the description on the page before we left, we were told the hike was &#8220;moderate&#8221; and that &#8220;a trekking pole (or two) is definitely recommended.&#8221; Trekking poles? **Two** trekking poles?! Also, &#8220;If you stop and sit on this rock, or any other, be careful not to fall off the side of the hill!&#8221; Woo! Fun! The 1000-mile elevation change was definitely tiring, but the weather was great. Here's a small selection of pictures: ![View from the path](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/IMG_4962-1.jpg "View from the path") View of the hills from the path ![Blue hills](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/IMG_4964-1.jpg "Blue hills") Blue hills, great day ![Large freakin rock](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/IMG_4971-1.jpg "Large freakin rock") Must I **really** climb up there Not much else, really -- more weekend ridiculousness in various bars and clubs around the city, some sightseeing and general wandering around the city. On the way to the MOMA with some friends, we passed by some storm troopers outside the Sony Metreon. ![Storm Troopers](http://yjblog.stupidchicken.com/images/IMG_4986.jpg "Storm Troopers") Can I see your ticket, please Ah, and there was Vegas, of course. I may have been back from there for more than 30 hours by now, but I'm still not certain I've fully recovered from the weekend. This trip was with the drawgroup (most of it, anyway), so things didn't bode well for my liver from the very start. My last two trips were relatively sane, considering the company: once with JC friends, the types who are substantially less likely to develop serious alcoholism problems than those I went with this time, and another time with family. This time, there was an unreasonable amount of gambling, and an equally unreasonable amount of drinking. I ended up down a little at the blackjack tables, but what I lost more than paid for the free drinks. I think I averaged about ten drinks a night, not that I could really count by the end of each night. And by &#8220;end of the night&#8221; I actually mean &#8220;8am in the morning&#8221;, which was when we tried to stumble back to the suite at the New Frontier hotel without getting hit by cars or puking all over the morning joggers. Who the hell goes to Vegas to jog in the morning on the strip? So that's all I have for this (part of the) trip. I realised that I actually started blogging on stupidchicken.com a few days before I left here after graduation to go back to NS. Feels nothing like that now, of course (ORD loh!!!, almost), but I'm sure I'll miss all these crazy drunkard friends all over again after I go.
