We've successfully shifted servers from [Webhostingbuzz](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com) to [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com), after the former kept going down for an hour a day according to [uptime](http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/) reports. As part of the latter's anniversary promotions, we managed to get 80% off our first year's subscription, so it's US$24 for the first 12 months of hosting. Steve gets his much-coveted shell access, everyone gets more space, and hopefully our email users get a bit more reliability. The transfer seems to have gone without much trouble, and everything worked on first try the morning after the DNS propagated to our Singapore servers... we're still waiting for the DNS transfer to DreamHost, and their support isn't as amazingly great as everyone mentioned (people's general enthusiasm could, of course, be explained by their referral program), but things look like they work. Good enough. Back to your regularly-scheduled chickens...
