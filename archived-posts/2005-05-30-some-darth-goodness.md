[Darth Vader Made Me Cry](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/darth_vader_made_me_cry.php) A wonderful little tale about how evil the Imperial Dark Lord truly is. I quite enjoyed ROTS. Peter David has a [review](http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/002931.html) that neatly summarises what I liked about Episode III (and, true to form, quotes Python on that one amusingly _Holy Grail_\-esque bit). He also writes about how Episode IV matches up from the end of Episode III [here](http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/002936.html), which makes me sorely want to rush out and buy the DVD box set. Argh.
