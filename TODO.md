- Images right now link to themselves. Can we have them pop up a modal of the enlarged version? 

- Feeds! Check what feeds are available at yjsoon.com, and make sure we match those. I think it's yjsoon.com/feed. It's proxied at https://feeds.feedburner.com/yjsoon but does that matter? Honestly not sure. Goal is to ensure that whoever is subscribed continues to be subscribed. 

- Redirects! Check the posts on yjsoon.com that we are still hosting, and set up redirects somehow? 

- Front page -- let's have 5 most recent posts, followed by 5 headlines. Styled nicely for the list -- shouldn't just be "h2s only", but some kind of list that shows the headlines (no summaries).
